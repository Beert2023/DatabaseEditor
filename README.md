# Database Editor for F1 Manager 23 #
Friendly to use tool for editing your save files from F1 Manager 23. Supports driver transfers for now, but more options will be added in the future!

### What's the Database Editor? ###
Basically it's just a friendly user interface that helps you make the modifications you wish for the databasde from your save file from F1 Manager 23

It's developed by the same guy (me, u/ignaciourreta on Reddit) who developed multiple scripts for the F1 Manager 22 game as the driver trasnfer script, custom calendar, edit stats, or edit performance of cars

When I developed those scripts, more specifically the driver transfers script for the Script Manager for F1M22 I always had in mind to devlop a tool like this to make it easier to the user to take advantage of my scripts

### How can I use thge Database Editor? ###
You'll need to have isntalled on your computer 2 things: Python and NodeJS.

If you used the script manager last year you should already have pytho installed. If not, download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (MAKE SURE to tick the box that says add python to the PATH system variable or something similar)

For NodeJS, you can download it from here https://nodejs.org/en/download, just select the installer for your system. 

Now, if you have installed succesfully both of them, you should be able to run both py and npm commands on a cmd. You can do this for extra checking, but this is NOT MANDATORY.
If you don't like cmds, don't worry, I have designed this to not require you to use them.
