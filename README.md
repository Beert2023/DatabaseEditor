# Database Editor for F1 Manager 23 #
Friendly to use tool for editing your save files from F1 Manager 23. Supports driver transfers, calendar customization, staff stat editing and car eprfromance editing, but the tool is still in constant development!

**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND**: This are the first few iterations and will only get better with time. It will get regular updates to support more functionallity.

If you have any issues, I recommend first look at the Troubleshoot guide for the most common error: https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Troubleshoot-guide. If this doesn't fix the error, you can open an Issue on GitHub

## What's the Database Editor? ##
Basically it's just a friendly user interface that helps you make the modifications you wish for the database from your save file from F1 Manager 23

It's developed by the same guy (me, u/ignaciourreta on Reddit) who developed multiple scripts for the F1 Manager 22 game as the driver trasnfer script, custom calendar, edit stats, or edit performance of cars

When I developed those scripts, more specifically the driver transfers script for the Script Manager for F1M22 I always had in mind to devlop a tool like this to make it easier to the user to take advantage of my scripts

### What can I actually edit with the Database Editor? ###

1. Driver transfers
2. Editing driver contracts
3. Editing all staff (including drivers') stats
4. Customize your calendar (run **ONLY** before the first race of the season)
5. Buff or nerf any car part of any car
6. Edit the performance and durability of any of the 4 engines suppliers

## How can I install the Database Editor? ##
If you're on Windows you'll only need one thing: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run the installer

It's all covered in the [Installation and set-up guide]([https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Installation-guide](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Installation-and-set%E2%80%90up-guide))

### How can I update the Database Editor if I had a previouos verision? ###

It's all explained in the [Update guide](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Update-guide), although, from 1.4 onwards, it's as easy as clicking a button!

## For any issues ##

You can try to look at them at the [Troubleshoot Guide](https://github.com/IUrreta/DatabaseEditor/wiki/Troubleshoot-guide), although this was made prior to 1.5, so when Python **was** required, so it will get updates as time goes on from 1.5 onwards. If you **already have Python installed** and the regular `run.vbs` is not working for you, you can try running `runpython.vbs` and it will open the same way as before 1.5
